Is Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.

* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
* Select the "Repair your computer" option
* Select "Command Prompt"
* Input "bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force" (without quotes)
* Restart the PC

Note: If the above doesn't fix your boot issue then use the command "bootsect.exe /nt60 ALL /force" instead. Just make sure you remove all USB flash drives before you use the command.

#   2   -   Genuine status
##########################################################################
Have you installed the loader but you're not genuine? Just check the following.

* Check the details line contains "v2.1"
* Try to validate online at http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/

Note: If the details line doesn't read v2.1 then go to the advanced tab, select to disable type 4 memory and reinstall the loader. If that doesn't work then use the legacy mode instead.

#   3   -   Questions and answers
##########################################################################
Q. The loaders status says "Modified - Uninstall other cracks", what do I do?
A. You can either find a way to uninstall the other cracks, download WAT Fix or format. http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/26994

Q. The loaders status says "Unsupported partition table", why is this?
A. You're either using GPT on a UEFI motherboard or you've got a locked OEM partition. Both problems can be fixed by fully formatting your entire hard drive.

Q. I received the error message "Error finding your systems active partition", what do I have to do?
A. You need to format the whole hard drive with a program like Active@ Kill Disk. This issue is caused by your locked OEM partition. http://software.lsoft.net/boot-cd-iso.zip

Q. I received the error message "Failed to add loader to the boot code", what do I have to do?
A. Disable any system protection. Some types of software block the loader application from installing to the boot code.

Q. I've used a version of the loader before and it failed to work, what do I have to do?
A. If you previously used bootsect to get back into Windows then you first need to press uninstall, reboot and then install the newest version of the loader.

Q. Why was table sorting changed so that it's now disabled by default?
A. Some machines don't like the table order being changed so to make the loader more system compatible we disabled it by default.

Q. I've previously used another activation solution and I think it's modified my systems files, can I fix it?
A. You can first try to uninstall what you originally installed and then try running "sfc.exe /scannow" from command prompt as an administrator.

Q. I lose activation status after my systems been to sleep or has been in hibernation, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and my system hangs during the boot process, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you're not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and rebooted but I'm not activated. The loader application displays the message "BAD SLIC SIZE" or "BAD SLIC DATA", can I fix it?
A. Uninstall the loader, power down and then boot up the system again. Go to the applications advanced options and select to ignore the existing SLIC and then press install.

The loader doesn't work when the systems using GPT via UEFI. The workaround is to pre-format your hard drive so that it uses MBR instead.

From your BIOS select to boot the Windows DVD without UEFI, go to the repair options, select command prompt and then enter this:

diskpart
list disk
select disk 0
clean
convert mbr
create partition primary
select partition 1
format fs=ntsf quick

Boot the Windows DVD the same way you did the first time and then continue with the installation of Windows. Once complete you can install the loader.

#   7   -   Arguments
##########################################################################
/silent
 Turns on silent mode

/restart
 Restart the OS after install (used with /silent)

/norestart
 Prevents system restart after successful installation

/preactivate
 This just helps the loader decide on it's environment

/bios
 Force the application to install just the certificate and serial

/loader
 Force the application to install the loader

/swap
 Install the loader without changing your systems boot code

/k=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
 Set the Windows 7/2008/Vista key

/c=
 Set the certificate (use the name of a certificate from the certificates folder or from the SLIC list)

/s=
 Set the SLIC (Acer, Advent, Alienware, Aquarius, Asus, AT Computers, BenQ, BGH e-Nova, Casper, CCE, Chuangzhicheng, Crea, Dealin, Dell, Excimer, EXO, Exper, Founder, FSC, Fujitsu, Genuine, Gigabyte, Haier, Hannspree, Hasee, HCL, Higrade, HP, Hyrican, Itautec, Jooyon, Kraftway, KSystems, Lanix, Lenovo, LG, Medion, MSI, NEC, Nokia, Olidata, ONKYO, Panasonic, Paradigit, Philco, Positivo, Quanmax, Samsung, Sony, Stone, Synnex, Systemax, Tarox, Tongfang, Toshiba, Trigem, Twinhead, Vestel, Viewsonic, Viliv, Wortmann, Zoostorm)

======
* If you don't set the certificate it will default to your BIOS's model
* If you don't set the SLIC it will default to your BIOS's model
* If you don't set the key it will default to your BIOS's model and the correct one for the OS (Ultimate, Professional, Starter or Home Premium)
* You can use these arguments via SetupComplete.cmd to pre-activate Windows 7/Vista/Server 2008
======

Example:
"D:\Windows Loader.exe" /silent /restart /k=342DG-6YJR8-X92GV-V7DCV-P4K27 /c=Acer /s=Acer


SetupComplete.cmd Example:

@ECHO OFF
%~dp0"Windows Loader.exe" /silent /preactivate
cd %~dp0

If a certificate or SLIC is released and I have not put out a new version of my application simply create two folders, one called "Certificates" and another called "SLICs".

In each folder put the files you want to add support for, just be sure you label the files like this:

*Certificates folder*
Acer.XRM-MS
Advent.XRM-MS
Alienware.XRM-MS
Asus.XRM-MS


*SLICs folder*
Acer.BIN
Advent.BIN
Alienware.BIN
Asus.BIN


When using external files all preset internals will be ignored. This is a cleaner approach for users who want to build their own list without my presets getting in the way.

Everyone who supports this project, you're all the reason I'm still working on it.
