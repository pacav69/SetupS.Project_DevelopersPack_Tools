<p class=rvps2><span class=rvts6>There are basically two ways of handling the OSArch issue(s): </span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts7>Type 1</span></p>
<p class=rvps4><span class=rvts8>SingleArch-Installer --&gt; SingleArch-Installed.</span><span class=rvts6> It is the most primitive but effective way of deploying apps. It only requires the release-package to designate the target OSArch in the .app-file (under &lt;Architecture&gt;). It is also going to have the smallest-sized deployment packages. But to be complete, one will need to create two such packages: one for x86 (32-bit) and another for x64 (64-bit). They'll also have separate but different file-names for each package, as discussed in "</span><a class=rvts10 href="FileNamingBestPractices.html">File-Naming Best Practices</a><span class=rvts6>" already (see bullet point 10).</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts7>Type 2</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 48px; list-style-position: outside;"><ol type="a" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 48px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li value=1 class=rvps5 style="margin-left: 0"><span class=rvts8>DualArch-Installer --&gt; SingleArch-Installed.</span><span class=rvts6> It is the scheme used almost exclusively with ssApps -- because their original installers were designed to install this way. We say </span><span class=rvts9>almost exclusively</span><span class=rvts6> because until now this was only used by ssApps -- this is a scheme that has been devised recently to work with ppApps as well. </span></li>
<li value=2 class=rvps5 style="margin-left: 0"><span class=rvts8>DualArch-Installer --&gt; DualArch-Installed.</span><span class=rvts6> It is a scheme </span><span class=rvts9>only</span><span class=rvts6> used by ppApps -- because only ppApps can utilize it. 'Nuff said.</span></li>
</ol></ul>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>This new scheme had created a bit of a problem for someone looking at a DualArch </span><span class=rvts9>ppApp</span><span class=rvts6>. Is it a Type 2a or 2b? Previously, the assumption could have been made that if it's an ssApp it's Type 2a and if it's a ppApp then it's Type 2b. So a decision was made on how to designate the two kinds of Type 2's and how to start naming the resulting deployment packages.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>There's no question that ssApp packages were on the scene first (so to speak) and they are in fact the more traditional-behaving unattended installing technique; whereas, ppApps are a more extreme and unique method of deployment that they are also an exclusive design of ssTek tools.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>Looking at it thus, it's obvious that the Type 2a DualArch used by ssApps (and now ppApps) should therefore be the default when "Any" is selected under &lt;Architecture&gt;. It will also require no extra filename tag since this is the naming scheme ssApp packages have been utilizing for quite some time already. (</span><span class=rvts9>Note:</span><span class=rvts6> there was a tag for these, "_x86-x64", but it was rarely used if at all.)</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>Type 2b is a universal DualArch but will now need a special tag added to the filename in order to distinguish this particular type of DualArch ppApp from it's Type 2a brother. It is this type that truly deserves to be called "DualArch" because it </span><span class=rvts9>IS</span><span class=rvts6> a true </span><span class=rvts9>Dual Architecture</span><span class=rvts6> -- and in every sense of the definition.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>Both types of "DualArch-Installer" ppApp packages are using the already established form of including both OSArch's under their respective subfolders ("_x86\" &amp; "_x64\") -- all contained in the ppApp.7z archive -- and the shortcut flags for handling the respective OSArch's ("Is_x86" &amp; "Is_x64").</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>So to toggle between either type of "DualArch-Installer" ppApp package, one only needs to </span><span class=rvts9>"Edit"</span><span class=rvts6> the .app-file (or .apz-file) with </span><a class=rvts12 href="ssEditor.html">ssEditor</a><span class=rvts6> and simply select Architecture "Any" (for Type 2a) or "DualArch" (for Type 2b)</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>The first one, "Any" -- the default -- will merely install the single-OSArch package of the target system. To accomplish this, SetupS </span><span class=rvts9>excludes</span><span class=rvts6> installing </span><span class=rvts9>the other</span><span class=rvts6> OSArch package of the target system (i.e., the "_x86\" or "_x64\" subfolders). For example, if installing one of these packages on an x86 system, the "_x64\" subfolder will be </span><span class=rvts9>missing</span><span class=rvts6>. This is important in case any common files or folders are also included in the ppApp.7z archive. To get the other OSArch installed, one will need to boot into an OS of the other arch and re-install the ppApp </span><span class=rvts9>from its original deployment package</span><span class=rvts6>.</span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps3><span class=rvts6>The last one, "DualArch" installs </span><span class=rvts9>both</span><span class=rvts6> OSArch packages regardless of the target system's OSArch. To establish shortcuts of the other OSArch, one will simply need to boot into an OS of the other arch and run Regenerator (or use SendTo SetupS on the ppApp's installed folder).</span></p>
