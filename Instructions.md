## git-large-file-storage (git lfs)
GitHub limits the size of files you can track in regular Git repositories.
The git lfs app uploads the actual file to a github lfs and stores a link in the repo.
Large files such as EXE, ISO and APZ can be uploaded but there are file size limitations check the website for more details.

more information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/)

### How-to
install git lfs app or git-lfs-windows apz

open git bash cmd
change to github directory

to check the installation in git bash cmd type:

    git lfs install

add the file extension to track
eg
    git lfs track "*.psd"


add these in git bash cmd

    git lfs track "*.exe"
    git lfs track "*.iso"
    git lfs track "*.apz"

this will add the file extensions to '.gitattributes' file to track.

use shift insert in git bash cmd
